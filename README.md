# Don't Close
This script prompts the user with a confirmation box if they try to navigate away from Foundry in their browser. I wrote it after constantly closing out of the application while looking up spells and rules. This script will first check to see if it is running in a browser, and will be disabled if it is not. So if you are running this in the Foudry stand alone application it will not work.
